Programming in assembly language using the LC-3

To use the following LC-3 code, please download and install the latest Java Runtime Environment from Java's main page . The software is needed to run the executable Java archive in which the PenSim LC-3 simulator is written. When executing and assembling .asm and .obj files via the PenSim command line, be sure that the PenSim.jar file is located in the same directory as the files. Files can be accessed from a seperate directory using the "File" options list otherwise.

To get the programs up and running,

and type as (file).asm, ENTER, ld (file).obj, ENTER
set PC x3000, ENTER. Then type continue to run.
